Example of Recurrence Relations in some famous algorithms-

Fibonacci Sequence
F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2)

Factorial of a number n
F(n) = n * F(n-1)

Merge Sort
T(n) = 2*T(n/2) + O(n)

Tower of Hanoi
H(n) = 2*H(n-1) + 1

Binary Search
T(n) = T(n/2) + 1


Various types of Recurrence Relations are:

    1	Linear Recurrence Relations
    2	Divide and Conquer Recurrences
    3	Substitution Recurrences
    4	Homogeneous Recurrences
    5	Non-Homogeneous Recurrences
